# Icon Placeholder Files

Since we can't create actual PNG files through text, you'll need to create these icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use an accessibility symbol (♿ or 🌐)
- Blue and white color scheme (#4f46e5)
- Simple, clean design
- High contrast for visibility

## Tools to Create Icons:
1. **Canva** - Easy online design tool
2. **GIMP** - Free image editor
3. **Photoshop** - Professional design tool
4. **Figma** - Web-based design tool
5. **IconJar** - Icon management tool

## Quick Icon Creation:
You can use any of these emoji as temporary icons:
- 🌐 (globe)
- ♿ (accessibility)
- 👁️ (eye)
- 🔧 (tools)

Just convert them to PNG format in the required sizes.
